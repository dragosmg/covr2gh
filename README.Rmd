> Test Coverage Summary on 'GitHub'

On a GitHub pull request, {covr2gh} runs `covr::package_coverage()` on both branches involved. It compares the outputs, summarises key findings, and posts them in a comment.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {covr2gh} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dragosmg/covr2gh")
```

## Usage

It comes with a helper function that generates a GitHub action workflow and adds a badge to your README, if it can find the {usethis} badge "block" (`<!-- badges: start -->` and `<!-- badges: end -->`).

```r
covr2gh::use_covr2gh_action()
```
