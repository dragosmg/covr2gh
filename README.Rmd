{covr2gh} was born from a need to have test coverage information to hand when reviewing a pull request.

Due to constraints in enterprise environments, this often needs to be accomplished without depending on a 3rd party vendor, or an [un-verified](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/create-and-publish-actions/publish-in-github-marketplace#about-badges-in-github-marketplace) / unvetted GitHub Action.

The core functionality focuses on extracting coverage data (with `covr::package_coverage()`) and on presenting a brief summary as a comment on a GitHub pull request (PR).


## Installation

You can install the development version of covr2gh from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dragosmg/covr2gh")
```

## Example

The package is designed to be used with GitHub Actions. It has an accompanying workflow that does the following:

* runs `covr::package_coverage()` on both the head and base branches.
* compares and summarises the outputs in a couple of sentences.
* adds collapsible sections with tables containing more details.
* renders a badge and pushes it to a dedicated branch (`covr2gh-storage`).
